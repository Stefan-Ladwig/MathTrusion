# MathTrusion
This project tries to create 3D models from a 2D shape, just like the extrusion-tool from CAD Software like Fusion360, but with a mathematical twist.</br>
Basically you choose the base shape plus the path along which it is extruded and optionally a rotation and/or a scaling of the shape along that path.

It is currently a Python only project, but this might change with my skillset.
The two major libraries used are numpy for math and mayavi for creating and viewing the 3D models.

There is no working prototype yet, but i'm confident there will be soon.
