# MathTrusion
This tool creates a 3D from a 2D shape, just like the extrusion-tool from CAD Software like Fusion360, but instead of drawing lines and adjusting some parameters you hand over mathematical functions.</br>
Basically you choose the base shape plus the path along which it is extruded and optionally a rotation and/or a scaling of the shape along that path.

## some examples:
![Screw](pics/screw.png)
![Star Helix](pics/star_helix.png)
![Triangle Parabola](pics/triangle_parabola.png)
![Squircle Circle](pics/squircle_circle.png)
![Mobius Loop](pics/mobius_loop.png)

Libraries used: numpy for math and mayavi for creating and viewing the 3D models.
